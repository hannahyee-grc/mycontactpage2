                <h3>A little about me:</h3>
                <p>Ever since I was young, I’ve always been really into movies. I always think about all the aspects that go into movies such as music, production, script, and camera work. Not only for traditional films, I find animation captivating. How something can be made up using all the aforementioned aspects in addition to being completely artificially created. Growing up watching Disney and other animation studios, I didn’t think too much about how it was all made. In more recent years however, I’ve become more intrigued by it, especially the 3D animation. How it all starts from an idea, brought to building settings, characters, and landscapes from scratch, onto painting and piece by piece, animating. 
    
                <p>I often spend my free time drawing, reading, or watching movies. I love the concept of storytelling. I find it fascinating that some things start from just a mere idea and have the potential to grow into something known worldwide. I always admired that, which is why I strive to work in the animation field, to bring stories to life for everyone to enjoy.</p>
                
                <p> Working in not only the movie industry but especially animation requires more than adequate expertise in multiple regions. Some skills I can contribute in the workplace include acute attention to detail, as well as straightforward and constructive communication. Throughout my time as the director of art displays at my local community library, I was given the chance to really refine and establish those skills in a professional setting. These skills, and others, such as organization, creativity, and leadership, would aid and thrive in working in animation, both with the creative process and the operations behind the scenes of creating new stories and media. It is my goal to further educate myself about animation and how it’s made by assimilating myself into environments where I can both learn and give to animation and its continuing advancements.</p>
